# Portfolio - Padarthi Sumadhanu

This repository contains a static portfolio website built with Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

## Files
- `index.html` - Main HTML file (references Tailwind CDN, Font Awesome CDN).
- `styles.css` - Extracted custom CSS from original single-file design.
- `main.js` - Extracted JavaScript (menu, typewriter, scroll reveals, contact form simulation).
- `README.md` - This file.

## How to use
1. Unzip the archive.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. For production, consider installing Tailwind properly (npm + build) rather than using CDN.

## Notes
- The Tailwind CDN is used for quick prototyping. For production, switch to a proper Tailwind build to remove unused CSS.
- Icons use Font Awesome CDN.
